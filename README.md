# Collision Avoiding Path Finding Algorithm

the project revolves around coming up with a gentic algorithm that allows a number of robots each set on a graph node as a starting point, 
to reach his end point with minimising the collision rate.


A robot is created with the simulation, alongside with it's path. 
A user can move the robot on step on it's path by clicking the space bar and in order get the result directly a user is invited to click the Key "F"
